# CSharp_MondayCollections_Week14B

<h2>Exercises with C# Collections</h2>

This repository contains a part of my tasks for this week in Codecool.

I had to use different Collections in C# to solve given problems:

<dl>
  <dt>ArrayList</dt>
  <dd>This program ask the user for some string, stored them in an ArrayList, then sorts and finally writes them to the Console.</dd>
  <dt>Dictionary</dt>
  <dd>This program ask the user for a string, then changes the written numbers in the text to numerals (e.g.: “three” - 3), then writes it to the Console. The string and the numerical pairs had to be stored in a Dictionary type.</dd>
  <dt>LinkedList</dt>
  <dd>This program uses three different LinkedList and a Person class defined by me. A Person object has a name (string), an age (integer) and a height (double) attribute. The first LinkedList takes integers, the second one takes string and a third one stores Person objects given by the user. The user can creat his/her own Person objects based on the Person class. The user can also use a default set of Person objects to add them to the LinkedList. Finally, the program writes the contents of the three LinkedList in the stored order to the Console.</dd>
  <dt>List</dt>
  <dd>This program ask the user for some string, stored them in a List, then sorts and finally writes them to the Console.</dd>
  <dt>Stack</dt>
  <dd>This program ask the user for some integer, stored them in a Stack, and finally writes them to the Console in reverse sequence.</dd>
</dl>
